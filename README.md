The video demonstrating everything about this can be found through this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5xOYX9Hz7c

To use, go to the app folder and the src folder, and run the code in a java compiler of your choice.
You will be asked if you are running this as a member, a trainer, or an admin. 

If you are a member, you will be asked if you want to create a new member account, edit the current acconut, 
create a new goal, add new health metrics, display the health metrics, and register for any available classes.

If you are a trainer, you will be asked if you want to add a new available time you are available, and/or see what classes you are training

If you are an admin, you will be asked if you would like to create a new class
